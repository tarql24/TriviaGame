# TriviaGame

This one of my first homework assignments for class. I created a 90's Hip Hop Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

The multiple choice questions along with a timer that you must complete the questions before time to finish the quiz runs out. The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

### Give the game a Go!!
You can play the game [here](https://tarql24.github.io/TriviaGame/) at my Github master branch
